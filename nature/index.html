<h1>
Case Study in the State of Nature
</h1>

<div>By Sheyne Anderson</div>

<p>
Near the begining of the enlightenment, Thomas Hobbes and John Locke amongst others
were studying why humans do what they do. In order gain some freedom from the 
church, and thus to allow studying without simply invoking biblical truth, they 
hypothesized a "State of Nature". While the conceptitions of the State of Nature
varied, common themes were
</p>

<ul>
<li>a lack of language,</li>
<li>a lack of property,</li>
<li>and a lack of government.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Hobbes famously supposed that in such an environment, life would be 
"nasty, brutish and short." Locke on the otherhand took a softer approach. He 
supposed that property was the source of conflict and that in the State of 
Nature, humans would essentially ignore each other. 
</p>
<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>
In order to investigate further I created a simulation where humans would
be modeled with three basic attributes: Strength, Health, and Aggression. 
Where I sampled initial strength from the uniform distrubution on 0 to 2 [written U(0, 2)],
health from the normal distrubution with mean 1 and standard deviation 1/2 [written N(1, 1/2)], 
and aggression from U(0, 1). What this means 
is that strength is just as likely to be any number from 0 to 2 as any other
and the same for agression on 0 to 1. Finally initial health is pulled 
from a bell curve with its peak at 1, looking like:
</p>

<p>
note that the center of the curve is at health=1. From here I sample a population of 2000
individuals and simulate encounters. The idea is that if the aggression of either individual
is above a certain threshold, a fight will occur. Otherwise nothing will happen. This way
I can sample I1, an individual from the population of individuals with an aggression above
the threshold, and I2 an individual from the general population. This way a fight will 
alway occur, and I will not waste time simulating peaceful interactions where nothing happens.
</p>

<p>To determine the winner of a fight, I tried a couple different models. The main idea of all
of them is: get the respective strengths of I1 and I2, introduce some noise into those numbers
so that both parties have a chance, and then have the individual with the higher noisy strength
win. The winner gets a permanate boost in strength and the loser loses health. To prevent strength
from growing in an unbounded manner, I use the sigmoid of the strength.</p>

where sigma(x) is:

<p>
The idea is that initially increases in strength should have a large effect, but 
further increases should have diminishing returns in terms of percieved strength.
Additionally, if health drops below zero, that individual is removed, and a new individual
is added with the same inital stats as a member of the surviving population had. For 
better specifics, read the simulation code <a href="state_of_nature_sim.py">here</a>.
</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>I tried a several different variations on the above parameters and here are some results.
Below is the population histogram of agression over time.</p>

<p>Because of the random nature of the process, I get varying results. In one case I
ended up with a race of peaceful super stong individuals. In many the agressives kill everyone.
The whole thing is far too sensitive to my choices of parameters to get really meaningful results
from it. The big take home is that, from a super simplified prespective, Locke's model
does work in some cases. A result that I found quite surprizing.</p>
<h2>Defects with this Model</h2>
<p>Creatures don't have finite life-spans, so high strength individuals might stick around forever.
This is largely countered by the saturation of the sigmoid function and the chance involved with fights
which means that nobody can end up with no risk of death. </p>
<p>I poorly explored the parameter space. I should modivate the parameters I chose with biology 
or physics and systematically vary the others to measure the sensitivity of the model to 
its parameters.</p>
<h2>Further Study</h2>
<p>Adapt a simple decision system to the individuals so they can choose who to fight. Only fight 
scrawny looking creatures, etc. Possibly add a mechanism by which tribes could emerge e.g.
only attack things that don't do a certain signal or have some attribute.
