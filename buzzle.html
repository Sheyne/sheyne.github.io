<h1>Buzzle</h1>

Buzzle is a team drinking game where participants collaborate to each shotgun a beer and solve a 36 piece puzzle.<p>

<h2>Important rules:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Any regular 12oz carbonated beverage can be shotgunned</li>
<li>Puzzle must be a 36 piece Crocodile Creek puzzle</li>
<li>Leaderboard can contain only one copy of each pair of names. You can improve your time with a given partner, but it must replace your old time</li>
<li>Stopwatch starts before the shotgun begins and ends when the puzzle is completed. Times are <i>truncated</i> to minutes and seconds, fractional seconds are dropped.</li>
<li>Leaderboards are always tied to a specific puzzle. When a new buzzle is acquired, you much start a new leaderboard</li>
</ul>
